The advent of digital technology, once believed to jeopardize the significance of space, mediates and reconfigures how people experience and navigate places. From pandemic to climate change to globalizing gentrification and migration, there are abundant sociological inquiries that require the understanding of how social groups, institutions, and resources are spatially organized. This module is designed to equip students with tools that will help them explore these topics. The following is a series of tutorials prepared for the Spatial Data and Mapping module from Advanced Quantitative Methods in Contemporary Sociology course. This module specifically aims to teach students how to gather, process, and visualize spatial data for sociological research. Some prior experience or familiarity with quantitative data and statistical software (R) is necessary to follow the tutorials. However, no prior experience in spatial data and/or software is assumed. Each tutorial is a chapter in this website. You can navigate through the chapters using the sidebar. 1.1 Table of Contents Different types of spatial data Geocoding, spatial join, mapping Mapping (continued) "],["spatial-data-for-sociological-research.html", "Chapter 2 Spatial Data for Sociological Research 2.1 Aggregated demographics 2.2 Point of interest 2.3 Explore further: Other types of spatial data", " Chapter 2 Spatial Data for Sociological Research In this chapter, we will discuss two different types of spatial data that are commonly used for sociological research. 2.1 Aggregated demographics To understand migration and residential patterns, sociologists often study where people live and move to. Topics like segregation, gentrification, integration/assimilation, and diversity/fractionalization can be studied using aggregated demographic data for a given geographic unit. In conducting such analysis, defining a geographic unit and boundary suitable for your research question is critical. Gentrification Stage Scores in Chicago and Seattle.

Aggregated demographic data is often collected and disseminated by national and municipal government, as well as international organizations (e.g., United Nations).
