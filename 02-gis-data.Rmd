# Spatial Data for Sociological Research

In this chapter, we will discuss two different types of spatial data that are commonly used for sociological research.

## People: Demographic data

To understand migration and residential patterns, sociologists often study where people live and move to. Topics like segregation, gentrification, integration/assimilation, and diversity/fractionalization can be studied using aggregated demographic data for a given geographic unit. In conducting such analysis, defining a geographic unit and boundary suitable for your research question is critical.

Are you interested in nations, cities, regions, or neighborhoods? How do you define their boundaries? Is relevant data available? Aggregated demographic data is often collected and disseminated by national and municipal government, as well as international organizations (e.g., United Nations). Check out the following data sources:

* Frech government
* US data

Exercise: Think about a geographic unit that you are interested in exploring. Find and get your data (attributes and boundaries). Define and justify your boundary.
